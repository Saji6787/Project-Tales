Project-Tales – AI-Powered Interactive Storytelling and Roleplay Platform

Project-Tales is a modern web application designed for creating and experiencing dynamic, AI-driven interactive stories and roleplay adventures. It seamlessly combines the creative freedom of character-driven platforms like Character.AI, the immersive narrative depth of AI Dungeon, and the branching decision mechanics of classic "Choose Your Own Adventure" stories.

[Core Features]:
- Unlimited story creation: Users define a title and initial prompt, enabling complete freedom across any genre — fantasy, science fiction, mystery, romance, horror, or beyond.

- Immersive AI-generated narration: The AI produces high-quality, coherent story segments (150–250 words) tailored to the ongoing context and user-defined world.

- Intelligent branching choices: Each segment concludes with 3–5 meaningful, contextually relevant action options generated by the AI.

- True consequences: Player choices directly shape the story path, with full conversation history preserved for consistent and personalized continuity.

- Personal story management: Users can save, edit, restart, or delete their private story collections at any time, securely tied to their account.

- Fully server-side processing: All AI computation runs online, ensuring a lightweight and responsive experience across devices.
